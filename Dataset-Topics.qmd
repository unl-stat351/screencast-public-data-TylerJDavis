Comments

- what years? Define the parameters of your analysis a bit more precisely. 
- "Worst vs. Best" by overall league performance? Win/loss record? what other measures are relevant?
- Will you consider the best hitter on the 2016 team and their development over time? How will you examine/compare that data? What is the comparison population? What do you want to know?
